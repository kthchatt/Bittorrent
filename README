	1. Known Issues

		- Some clients seem to be rejecting our client. 
		  [KTorrent, Transmission]
		  Possible reasons for this may be the lacking support 
		  of µTP on our end.
		  (Tested and developed against µTorrent and BitTorrent.)

		- Does not compile with GTK3, use GTK2 when compiling!

		- GTK Produces some warnings at runtime, needs to be addressed.

		- The GTK file dialog will not find any files, relaunching the
		  client will fix this.

		- GTK sometimes fails to scale the columns to their correct 
		  size.

	2. System requirements

		Hardware
		  - An ethernet card and some other hardware which you already
		    should have installed in your system if you are reading
		    this.
		
		Dependencies
		  - Library pthread is used for threading.
		  - GTK2 is required for the graphical user interface.
		  - For the hashing algorithm SHA1, the library lcrypto is
		    required.

		Note on resource usage
		  - Should you find the software to be hogging your system, look
		    into the gui_update_thread() and more specifically the 
		    list_update() function. Updating the values in the graphical
		    user interface requires an expensive GTK API call. Reducing 
		    the FPS-define in GUI.c is another alternative.

	3. Installing the client

		3.1 Make sure you have the latest version from our Git repo.
			https://github.com/kthchatt/BitTorrent.git
		3.2 Read the README file, you should be reading it right now.
		3.3 Set your working directory to ccBitTorrent folder.
		3.4 Run the make - file.
		3.5 Download every torrent. Much download, many peer. very seed.

	4. Modifying the source code.

		* Are you tired of your bittorrent client?
		* Are you in desperate need of an upgrade.. ?
		* Did we not make the source code pretty enough!? 

		Well, you are in luck my friend. This project is OPEN SOURCE.

		4.1 Quick Overview

			GUI.c
			  Modding the user - interface.
		
			bencodning.c
			   Metainfo & Bencoding.
			
			createfile.c
			   File creation: current mode is allocate 
			   pre-download, you might want on-demand allocations.
			
			peerwire.c
			   Implementing the peerwire protocol, this is
			   where you look if you want to implement PEX,
			   streaming or µTP and anything else you can imagine.
			
			tracker.c
			   Implement DHT here.

			swarm.c
			   Implement ZeroConf here.
			   
			scrape.c/announce.c
			   Implement UDP trackers here.

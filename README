    == == == == == == == == == ==

	1. Known Issues

		- Some clients seem to be rejecting our client. 
		  [KTorrent, Transmission]
		  Possible reasons for this may be the lacking support 
		  of µTP on our end.
		  (Testing and developed against µTorrent and BitTorrent.)

		- Does not compile with GTK3, use GTK2 when compiling!

		- GTK Produces some warnings at runtime, needs to be addressed.

		- The GTK file dialog will not find any files, relaunching or
		  recompiling will fix it.

	2. System requirements

		- An ethernet card with an active Internet connection is 
		  beneficial.

		- The software is developed to be efficient, simple and plain,
		  however GTK is a resource HOG. Make sure your hardware is 
		  up to snuff.

		- For the hashing algorithm SHA1, the library lcrypto is
		  required.

		- Should you find the software to be way too demanding, look
		  into the gui_update_thread() and more specifically the 
		  list_update() function. Updating the values in the graphical
		  user interface requires an expensive GTK API call. Reducing 
		  the FPS-define in GUI.c is another alternative.

	3. Installing the client

		3.1 Make sure you have the latest version from our Git repo.
			https://github.com/kthchatt/BitTorrent.git

		3.2 Read the README file, you should be reading it right now.

		3.3 Set your working directory to ccBitTorrent folder.

		3.4 Run the make - file.

		3.5 Download every torrent. Much download, many peer. very seed.


	4. Modifying the source code.

		* Are you tired of your bittorrent client?
		* Are you in desperate need of an upgrade.. ?
		* Did we not make the source code pretty enough!? 

		Well, you are in luck my friend. This project is OPEN SOURCE.

		4.1 Quick Overview

			GUI.c
			  Modding the user - interface.
			
			bencodning.c
			   Metainfo & Bencoding.
			
			createfile.c
			   File creation: current mode is allocate 
			   pre-download, you might want on-demand allocations.
			
			peerwire.c
			   Implementing the peerwire protocol, this is
			   where you look if you want to implement PEX,
			   streaming or µTP and anything else you can imagine.
			
			tracker.c
			   Implement DHT here.

			swarm.c
			   Implement ZeroConf here.
			   
			scrape.c/announce.c
			   Implement UDP trackers here.
